I'm Albert Cao, and I'm currently a junior in high school.

Currently, my academic interests lie in math and computer science, specifically in olympiads and competitions.
I'm also interested in how both fields can be used to change lives, and I would love to pursue research
in those fields.

Aside from math and programming competitions, my other hobbies include fencing and traveling.

Some more about me:

Music:

- I played cello (with Dr. Maxim Kozlov) until my freshman year of high school, due to conflicts with fencing
- My favorite cello piece is Saint Saens Cello Concerto 1
- Some artists I like include (in order of most recent to least recent): Gracie Abrams, Taylor Swift, Playboi Carti, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, Coldplay, Laufey, beabadoobee, keshi
- My favorite song is Runaway (it'll always remind me of my grind for MOP), before that it was Cupid by FIFTY-FIFTY
- I like to try out different music, but K-pop never stuck with me

Fencing:

- I've fenced competitively for over seven years
- I am an épée fencer and fence with DC Fencers Club
- My favorite city for a fencing tournament is Salt Lake City, worst is Phoenix in the summer
