I'm Albert Cao, and I'm currently a junior in high school.

Currently, my academic interests lie in math and computer science, specifically in olympiads and competitions.
I'm also interested in how both fields can be used to change lives, and I would love to pursue research
in those fields.

Aside from math and programming competitions, my other hobbies include fencing and traveling.
