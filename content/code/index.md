These are links to projects I've done, or tutorials/essays
on certain things that I like. I don't have much right now
but I plan to update this later.

I interned at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory via the ASPIRE
program, under the mentorship of Shane Donahue. In doing so, I learned
Assembly, C/C++, Python and Go, working in Reverse Engineering and Cybersecurity.
