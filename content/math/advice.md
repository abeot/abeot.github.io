title: Advice for Studying for AIME
desc: A brief overview of a study strategy for AIME
---

I've noticed that my biggest increases in skill have always
occured when I've done significantly harder problems, so that's
what my training philosophy is on. I also tend to work harder
when I know the material is **high quality** and arranged
**in a way that makes it easy to digest and complete**,
which is why I enjoy going through well structured handouts.
However, **classes serve as a way to pace myself and force
progress to be made**, which can be good during slumps
or when other activities take priority.

One of the biggest mistakes that I've made in training
is **not having a decisive plan**. This often leads to 
very little progress being made each day or very little
problems done. This is a problem that things like handouts
and classes are meant to be done. However, it's important
to have **incentive for the material to be completed**,
whether or not the [motivation is extrinsic or intrinsic](/writing/motivation.html).

Now, here is a plan intended for self-study, or
people who like handouts and learning by doing problems:

1. Start by getting a rough overview of what to know,
by either looking at an AIME class syllabus or looking through
BOGTRO's AIME Study Guide, found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/icds9u5yo0xypyf/AIMElist.pdf?dl=0).  

2. Start learning the concepts necessary by doing handouts on the topics.
Order does not matter, but do the more fundamental or common topics first.
**It is at this step that you should start saving solution outlines
of completed problems**.  

3. Start doing problems by **starting at the earliest AIMEs, since
these require knowledge of fundamentals**. Don't worry if the problems
start out easy, 1-5 is still good silly practice; **make sure to
save solution outlines so you understand the thought process**. Attempt
all questions, but if there is a question you have no idea, don't worry.
For questions that you make substantial progress but do not complete
or miss by a litte bit,
look at the solution and then try to solve the problem using the newfound
knowledge. Remember, these problems are the ones just above your level.  

4. The AMCs might be coming up, so just mock once a week-the problems
should feel really natural now that the motivation for AIME problems
has been picked up.   

5. If you still have months left and have completed almost all the past
AIMEs, **start going through the problems that were too hard at the start**.
You should find solutions that become more natural because the motivation
has been learned. Also, **start going through college competitions,
like HMMT Feb, CMIMC and PUMaC**. Practice with them like how you practiced
with the AIMEs. **Remember, solutions should still be recorded**.   

6. Assuming that there is still time left, **you should not comfortably
be able to solve the first 12 untimed**. At about a month before
the competition, **start doing mock AIMEs once per week; too much
does not help, mock AIMEs are only intended to make one
comfortable with testing strategy and difficulty, not actual practice**.
If you haven't finished the previous staps, don't worry; just start
the weekly mocks a month before.   

7. The day before the test, just relax, maybe solve some interesting
problems but nothing that is too infuriating. **Sleep well, make sure
to eat a banana and dark chocolate the day of**. Also, remember
not to treat it as a real thing but just like another mock; in particular,
**don't change the test strategy and feel free to skip around,
and use a lot of scratch paper and keep work neat and checked**.  

The point of this outline is not to serve as a plan,
but rather an idea of how much work it will take. 
**Take this with a grain of salt, as this advice
will not apply to everyone**. In particular,
**if you feel more satisfaction saying you did
all past AIMEs rather than actually treating
each problem as nice example and a way to learn, you are doing it wrong**.

Something to note: part of writing down solutions is **to
make the thought process clear, thus minimizing sillies**.
Also, this strategy probably takes about 9 months or a year to 
execute, so it is something perfect to employ for someone who has
just qualified for AIME or AMC DHR and has gotten a 2-7 on AIME.
If you barely missed the AMO/JMO cutoff, no pressure; just 
make sure to be doing computational practice with 
HMMT/CMIMC/PUMaC, but you should be training for oly.

Obviously, if you are not doing self-study and doing
actual classes, it would look a lot different. Just following
the curriculum should be fine, and mixing in extra practice and mocks 
is already enough before the AMC/AIME.
