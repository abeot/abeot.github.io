title: Borderline Scores
desc: How to deal with scores literally one question away from qualification.
---

I've never qualified with a borderline AMC score or USAJMO index before,
but I always seem to miss the cutoffs by one question; in 7th grade,
I scored a 97.5 on the AMC 10A while the cutoff was 103.5, which I 
missed by a silly; this year (ninth grade), I missed the JMO cutoff
by 3 points, sillying 2 AIME problems and also a problem on the AMC.

## Sillies

A lot of people point to sillies and ask "how do I get ride of them?"
While many others might think that sillies are not sillies and in fact,
errors that can be corrected from practice, this is far from the 
truth.

I've noticed that I tend to silly a lot when I don't think through 
the thought process; an example is 2023 AIME I P9, where considering
the retriction of 2 is crucial in determining there are two cases.
While I managed to determine this, I forgot to consider how the 
polynomial could take two different forms. This, I think, is considered
a "strtegic silly", where the error is in the actualy strategy
formulation. These mostly come from rushing to a solution, 
and forgetting a condition, which also happened to me for 
2023 AIME I P7, where I completely forgot the modulo 6 idea.

There are also sillies in computation/forgetting to do some sort
of transformation at the end, which are also extremely annoying.
I've found that these are pretty easy to correct, with arithmetic
errors fixed by writing out the computation. On the other hand,
and transformations that are made should be noted on the scratch
paper, often at the top and in large words so one can remember them.

There are also sillies like reading the question wrong; This used
to be an issue for me (and an annoying one too), but by reading
the question twice before doing any work, it seemed to eliminate it too.

## Stop Sillying

There are also some instances when sillies are rather rare, and
in most cases do not just happen at all. These are usually 
school tests and olympiad problems.

In school tests, the ideas are almost always so simple that one
just needs to make sure their computation is right, and because
the idea is easy to come up with, there is a lot of time
to check and read the question. Thus, from here, we see a strategy;
think of the problem as simply as possible if the idea is clear,
and allot enough time to check. Checking is often easiest 
by first, plugging your answer back in if the question allows;
if not, then doing a sanity check; and finally, trying the problem
in a different way. Just going through your work again is actually 
pretty useless as your brain goes autopilot, but going the 
reverse way (from answer to original) can actually be quite
effective, because it's "new" to the brain.

For olympiad problems, it's extremely hard to silly, but it's 
also extremely hard to solve the problem. I think the reason why
is because a proof must written, and the proof must actually be true
(each step has to be logical). Thus, it's a good idea when practicing
hard problems to also write the solutions for the problems. Don't
include every single detail, but have an outline of the *strategy*;
this also helps with developing ideas and intuition, which
can help in making problems more simple.

## In-Test Stress

People cite stress of the test too as underperformance (I also do too!)
In honesty, I don't think just spamming mock tests is going to solve
this issue, nor is anything really; the key is to treat it exactly
like a mock test.

Say you encounter a dificult P8 on an AIME mock; I bet that you
would probably skip it and move on. However, on the real test,
our ego can get ahead of ourselves and we just continue on that
problem without progress; this is going to kill your scores,
and happened to be in both years when I barely missed the cutoffs.
Looking retrospectively, I should hvae just had more confidence in
myself; I knew I could easily do the first 12 so I should have
moved on, instead of thinking they were boing to be even harder
if P8 was already so hard.

## When Cutoffs Come Out

Remembering that many people are probably also in a similar
situation won't help; in fact, I think one needs to teach themselves
how to cope with loss. However, pain is our natural (and greatest)
motivator, so perhaps after missing a cutoff, we can be motivated
to work harder.

It's also important to understand one's level; there's a difference
between problems someone *can* solve, and problems someone *does*
solve. Missing the cutoff doesn't mean you should re-study
the AMCs or the AIME; in fact, I think that just means you should
try challenging yourself so your confidence increases. Confidence
is a **huge** factor in your underperformance, so it's best
to eliminate that. (As an anecdote, after taking an AIME-level class
with olympiad problems included in the homework sets, my AMC score
increase by almost 20 points. On the other hand, when I was 
"AIME level", doing AIME problems just because that was what I was
preparing for didn't do as much to expand my reach, and I should've
been doing final fives to give me a more massive confidence boost).

It's important to know that although there is a lot of time until
the next contest season, this doesn't mean to slack. Set expectations
higher! If someone is shooting for JMO instead of AIME, they will
be inclined to study harder; even if they don't make JMO, they may
make AMC DHR or AIME with a high enough score, which doesn't
hurt at all.
