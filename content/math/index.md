title: Math Resources
desc: Some of my math resources for preparing for the AMC/AIME.

**PSA**: I'm interested in starting running a few classes/program for
mid/late AIME prep (which also helps for AMCs!). 
The goal is to offer generous financial aid and flexible hours 
for those interested in contests but may have barriers.
If you would like to help with deciding what topics
should be included, or have anything you want to see,
please don't hesitate to contact me.



This page is for any resources I have, and any advice I have for AMC 10/12 and AIME.

I personally like [Evan Chen's OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html) for those 
who are ready or interested for the math olympiad world.

For earlier contests like MATHCOUNTS/AMC 8 and the early end of the AMCs, I liked [Alcumus](https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus)
to learn and get good practice problems; I also really enjoyed [Competition Math for Middle School](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/competition-math).

I also really like the advice on [Evan Chen's website](https://web.evanchen.cc/), especially [math contest platitudes v3](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2019/01/31/math-contest-platitudes-v3/).

In case someone wants, here are my [scores](scores.html) from my
years of competing in the AMCs.
