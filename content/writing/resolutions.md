title: New Year's Resolutions
desc: What I want to improve in 2025
---

I think that there's a difference between goals
and resolutions, in that goals are more tangible
and resolutions are changes in character or habit usually.

When I used to do New Year's Resolutions, I would do
the same number as how old I am, but I think that's a little
hard. Instead, I'll try to focus on the most important ones.

# The Resolutions

1. React less, think more
    1. In talking, this is like the canonical "think before you speak", but I think for me it applies more to how I act when a situation becomes unfavorable. The mind should move before the body. The converse was probably true when we were hunter gatherers, but in the modern world it's no longer applicable.
2. Be more open to ideas
    1. I think this used to be a really big strong suit, but as I've started to find "what works for me", I feel that I've gotten a little more rigid. I'm happy I realized this.
3. Yet, have the wisdom to choose the right thing to listen to
    1. My brother thinks I'm too easily influenced (probably an exaggeration), but he might think that way because I usually assume things are right faster than I think about why they are right. This probably won't matter for smaller decisions, but it's a good habit to think through two options without external bias of a website trying to sell its product.
4. Take things more seriously (competitions, tests, talking with other people, etc.)
    1. I bombed a test recently, which was probably the result of me not doing as much test prep as I should have. It's also important to realize I have the privilege to be there in the first place, and so I should cherish the opportunity.
5. Cut out things that aren't from my own motivation
    1. Some things that I do, or actions that I've done-- when I thought about them for a small bit--were only because others are doing them, but weren't really rational to me (a certain game with initials B.S.). Once I cut them out, I haven't lost much sleep from it and feel much more in control of my actions, at least for now.
6. Control the subconscious better
    1. There's a lot of things that humans do without thinking, and that's both amazing and a bit dangerous. Adopting terminology from *Thinking Fast and Slow*, I claim that System 1 can be rewired, possibly by using System 2 more to regain control of those habits.
7. Handle uncertainty better
    1. I think I need to realize that when I'm uncertain about doing X or Y, the best course of action is to just try out X or Y. This is something I've already learned in math, but even for trivial decisions I sometimes still hesitate (like waking up early on a Saturday or not).

# The Goals

I'm probably doing these a lot better than my peers, but they're still areas where I can improve.

1. Use the phone less
    1. I'm averaging a little less than 2 hours of screen time (is that good or bad?), but I want to get that number as low as possible. There are times during the school day where, instead of being on my phone, I could just be thinking about the top thing on my mind. It might seem a little weird, but I shouldn't be too influenced by others' reactions.
2. Sleep earlier, wake up earlier (even on weekends)
    1.  I remember reading somewhere that having a good sleep schedule requires consistency. I also think it's a good discipline building exercise (it's not like I'm losing sleep, I'm just shifting it earlier). I find that it also improves my mood and energy.
3. Continue journaling
    1. Self-explanatory. I've been doing it for over a year now (pretty amazing!), but I want to stretch that into 2025.
4. Add structure/non-negotiables into my day
    1. I understand the importance of loving what I do, and I really do. But there's also times when I don't want to do something, even when there's no point in not. It builds discipline and usually leaves me feeling much better at the end of the day.
5. Work out more consistently
    1. I've been working out for the past year, though on and off (summer 2023 was big, as well as fall 2024). I want to continue working out more regularly, including fencing workouts at home. 
6. Read more books
    1. Self-explanatory. My book taste is also something I want to discover, kind of like a music taste.
6. I would say do math better here, but that's expected of myself

# The Other Goals

I'll list some "material goals" here now, as well as how last year turned out.

1. Make MOP
    1. Self-explanatory. Quite a few people have told me I have a shot, and I'm not throwing away my shot. As long as I worked as hard as I could, I'll be happy.
2. Get a top-32 result in fencing
    1. Admittedly I've been fencing less (due to focusing more on math). But I'm still practicing at home and I hope I can get something out of it.
3. Qualify for USACO Platinum
    1. This is more of something I'm doing just for fun. I wouldn't mind too much if I do qualify or not, but I probably won't be studying as much (math is calling).

# Last Year's reflection

1. Make MOP (2024)
    1. This one was really sad, the only thing stopping me was JMO P2. I had the right idea, but didn't really think it would work out. If only I solved that problem...; I still got JMO Honors though (top 50), not bad for my first olympiad experience.
2. UMD Math Competition, Top 3
    1. I nailed this one. First place!
3. Top 10 at any college math competition, any subject
    1. I got PUMaC third place in Geometry, Division A, tied with like 10 other people. But still, I'm at the same level as people who I've looked up to.
4. Get a top 32 in juniors at a NAC, fencing
    1. Didn't get this one, I think I compromised fencing for the hopes of getting MOP. At least I stayed in the top 100 rankings for most of the season.

Overall, I think I did pretty well, but of course there's still room for improvement, both in me as a person and in what I can accomplish.

*And with that, the 2024 season comes to an end.*
