title: Asking Questions
desc: My thoughts on learning through asking
---

Recently, as I see my friends and others get their
college acceptances, I can't help but feel a little sad that
soon they're gone. They've helped me a lot, and I realize 
that it was because I wasn't afraid to ask questions.

## Open Bouting

As a fencer, there are practices called "open bouting", where people
come at a scheduled time and date to fence with others
rather than have structured drills or lessons. Naturally,
making the most out of it means initiating a move by asking
someone to fence.

When I was 12 or 13, my mom would bring me to these, but I would
rarely ask others to fence; either they would ask me, or I would end
up fencing my brother. It was only because I didn't want to waste
my time that I attempted to ask others. For nearly two months,
I was scared to approach others even though no one ever said no,
but slowly I started to get used to it.

## Mentors

Soon, my coach started asking me what I learned from fencing the 
older kids. I truthfully told him I wasn't sure, and so he said
it was necessary that I ask for advice when I need it. 

I started to think more about fencing on the car ride to practices,
especially about the questions I had or issues that I might need
to try and correct. I was comfortable asking my coach those questions,
and it didn't take long before I was asking older fencers for advice
after my bouts.

This slowly started to spill into other areas of my life. 
The greatest impact this has had on me was in math. I didn't
have much structured training in middle school besides weekly Math Club,
and they didn't have resources to train beyond MATHCOUNTS.
I had to train for the AMC 10 using my own plan of one 
past test a week, and begged my mom to buy me a math book.

In eighth grade I finally read "Stop looking for the right training"
on the Art of Problem Solving website (a website with a ton of math 
resources and forums). It was through that post that I found Evan Chen's website,
which led me to find Dennis Chen's MAST program. I shot Dennis an email 
to apply to MAST, and he was happy to let me in. When I needed help for AMC 10 preparation,
Dennis was willing to spend his time detailing is practice philosophy.

That email to Dennis gave me some of the best AIME resources,
which led to me meeting others who were helpful as well. In fact,
the MAST community was supportive (and extremely talented) as well, and they
inspired me to work harder. Even when I missed JMO by a small margin,
I was spurred to apply to OTIS where I was encouraged to ask even more questions.
I found a support system, and eventually a mentor to work closely with.

## Enjoy it

One by one, every one of those people who helped me are leaving,
moving on to bigger and better things. Sometimes I think about 
whether or not they'll remember me, or realize the impact they made.
I wonder if I'm ready for that next step, or if there's already 
people who are looking up to me that I just don't realize.

Above all, it was the people who I met that made asking questions
so much worth it. In the fencing community and in the math community,
I've gotten to meet some great people. And that's all I could ask for.
