title: On Falling Short
desc: A reflection

This post could have been much different.

For the past two years of my life, I've dedicated
all of my available time to studying for math. I didn't care
if that meant having to miss hangouts, or spending time
when I otherwise could be having fun, to solve 
the next problem on the paper.

I grew to love math out of the hard work I put in. The struggle with
the problem became personal to me. It was all that I could afford
to focus my mind on, and everything else needed to be blocked out.

In a way, it was simple. I made sacrifices, and I knew that these
were the sacrifices that I had to make. I had faith that everything
would turn out fine.

It didn't.

I know many people would wish they could have the same life as me.
But at least for myself, I have no words to describe the situation
I am in. I don't think it's unfair; I chose to spend more time
on preparing for olympiad problems, even if it meant a lower AIME score.

I didn't make USAMO. I missed the cutoff by 2 points.

This is the third time that, in an odd-numbered year, I felt short of
my goal by a miniscule amount. But it hurts so much more this time,
because it is a forced end to my story, with non conclusion.

In seventh grade, I scored a 97.5 on the AMC 10A. The cutoff was 103.5; if 
I just hadn't forgot a +1 in my equation, I would've made it.

In ninth grade, I had a 191.5 JMO index. The cutoff was 194. If I just had
not sunk so much time on problem 8, with a messy diagram, I could have caught
my error in either problem 7 or problem 9.

This year, I had a 235 USAMO index. The cutoff was 237. If I had just thought
about by answer for problem 12, and realized that a factor of sqrt2 makes
no sense in 3D and is only a projection, I would have made it.

More than anything, a void is now in my life. I centered the past two years
around math competitions; it was a hard choice, a sacrifice I made. When
I decided to do so, around March in freshman year, I knew it would be a sacrifice.
But the full realization of what it means to *truly sacrifice*, for it to
work out the way you didn't expect, has not hit until today.

I could've continued fencing, and I felt as if math was not in my life,
fencing would have consumed me. Yet instead of choosing the path of a recruited
athlete, I made the decision to instead become a MOPper; part of me just
wanted to prove that it is not an opportunity locked away for a few
select students who had the opportunity earlier on. I was close, but fell short.

I don't believe the lessons I learned, about suppressing emotions, distractions,
and immediate pleasures, will go to waste. A chapter might have ended, but another
has started.

What hurts the most is that now, all of that is a memory. It's not the present
anymore, not a continuation. I've always hated looking back and reminiscing;
it just feels like nothing is being changed. And as I often associate the 
music I listen to with the moment and feelings I have when listening to it,
it hurts even more when I replay those songs that filled my head during that time.

Maybe now, I can try to teach what I've learned, with no costs, something I've 
always wanted to do. Maybe now, I can try to learn guitar, something I've always
wanted to do. Maybe now, I can try to invest and earn money, something
I've always wanted to do.

Maybe it's not a bad thing. Maybe everything will work out, if I keep my head
clear and work towards the next goal. Maybe all the things that happen to me,
happen to me for a reason. I could've lived a much different life; a totally
different set of things could have happened to me. But would it really have
made it better? I don't know. And that's what makes this life so special.
