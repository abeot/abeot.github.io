title: The Choice of Improvement
desc: My thoughts on chains goals.

I'm currently reading *Sapiens* by Harari. I've found it to 
be a really good book, and one part resonated with me:

> The pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship, and not for the last time...
> they double their efforts and keep slaving away.

It always seemed like the ideal life to secure a high-paying
job, and to be able to raise a family and retire early. But
what history should have taught us is that what we earn
eventually becomes things that we take for granted. And life 
only gets harder.

Consider the example of the agricultural revolution. Historians
and most people alive today view it as one of the most remarkable
revolutions that turned humans from an insignificant speck on Earth
to the most powerful species that has the fate of
the world in its hands. This is far from the truth; the process
of cultivating crops was gruesome and in most cases much harder
than the hunter-gatherer way of life. Diseases became rampant,
the human body weakened over time, and societies were more
susceptible to famine and drought. Even today, many of the
creations that we have made to reduce mental and physical burden,
such as phones, emails and artificial intelligence, have only lead to more
anxiety and a stronger feeling of being overwhelmed.

The truth is, the promise of a better future is neither
guaranteed, nor even based on much true evidence.
The idea of pain today for the comfort of tomorrow used to be my
way to justify the work that I put day in and dayout;
but recently I've realized how silly this idea is.[^1]

School teaches us that hard work pays off. And the common
misconception, or maybe even intential implication, is
that we should focus on goals that satisfy us and
use that to justify the effort, however burdensome
and numbing, that is required. This is far from the truth,
because once someone does secure that job, or retire
themselves, then there is yet another objective to work
for, or an inevitable feeling of emptiness.

None of this is meant to discourage those working towards
their goals; I think discipline is best learned this way,
because realistically nothing can be fun doing all the time.
I've made excuses for myself to take days off when I shouldn't have,
and it only makes me feel worse the next day. Conversely,
pushing myself to go even on the toughest days makes it 
more rewarding; that's what it takes to be a champion, anyways.

Sooner or later however, the question of whether or not
the work is fulfilling needs to be answered. Using competitions
to motivate students, or athletes, can be a double-edged sword;
perhaps the only reason they pursue their respective skill
is due to the thrill of winning and putting in hours every day
to see progress. On the other hand, it stimulates interest
that can develop a normal kid to be one of the brightest
cybersecurity researchers, or help someone find a bright future that they otherwise would not have found.

The last few days have helped me realize this. What I've
been chasing this whole time is meaningless, if it'll all
come to an end with a feeling of relief and a job being finished.

Most of the time I try to reflect on my journey, I've
always had it through the lens of hard work and success.
I can confidently say that I was influenced by Kobe Bryant
to work as hard as I could, trying to outwork anyone 
and learn my craft. However, I can much less confidently determine
the motivation for doing so. Sometimes I believe it's
because I have a faith that everything will work out in the 
end, and that faith keeps me going. Other times, it's because
I want to prevent any feeling of regret, and not leave
any "what if's" about my effort.

I hope to answer this question soon; at our core, we should
do the work that we love doing, regardless of the outcome. The
best work is often done when someone loves it. There is no guarantee
of a better future, but we can make sure that we can do the work
that we love. And (un)coincidentally, most people who do get good
results from their work live with the latter idea in mind.

    extent people who justify selfish actions by believing they are making a big impact.
    However, I admire educators, scientists, etc. for the passion they have for their work;
    but it is ironic that those who benefit society the most are often paid the least.
