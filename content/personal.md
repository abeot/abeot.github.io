Music:

- I played cello (with Dr. Maxim Kozlov) until my freshman year of high school, due to conflicts with fencing
    - My favorite cello piece is Saint Saens Cello Concerto 1
- Some artists I like include (in order of most recent to least recent): Lamp, SZA, Frank Ocean, Playboi Carti, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, Coldplay, Laufey, beabadoobee, keshi
- My favorite song is Runaway (it'll always remind me of my grind for MOP), before that it was Cupid by FIFTY-FIFTY
- I like to try out different music, but K-pop never stuck with me

Sports:

- I've fenced competitively for over seven years
- I am an épée fencer and fence with DC Fencers Club
- My favorite city for a fencing tournament is Salt Lake City, worst is Phoenix in the summer
- I also enjoy watching basketball; my favorite player is Kyrie Irving, and my favorite team is the Dallas Mavs
