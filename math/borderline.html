			<h1>Borderline Scores</h1>
<p>I’ve never qualified with a borderline AMC score or USAJMO index
before, but I always seem to miss the cutoffs by one question; in 7th
grade, I scored a 97.5 on the AMC 10A while the cutoff was 103.5, which
I missed by a silly; this year (ninth grade), I missed the JMO cutoff by
3 points, sillying 2 AIME problems and also a problem on the AMC.</p>
<h2 id="sillies">Sillies</h2>
<p>A lot of people point to sillies and ask “how do I get ride of them?”
While many others might think that sillies are not sillies and in fact,
errors that can be corrected from practice, this is far from the
truth.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed that I tend to silly a lot when I don’t think through
the thought process; an example is 2023 AIME I P9, where considering the
retriction of 2 is crucial in determining there are two cases. While I
managed to determine this, I forgot to consider how the polynomial could
take two different forms. This, I think, is considered a “strtegic
silly”, where the error is in the actualy strategy formulation. These
mostly come from rushing to a solution, and forgetting a condition,
which also happened to me for 2023 AIME I P7, where I completely forgot
the modulo 6 idea.</p>
<p>There are also sillies in computation/forgetting to do some sort of
transformation at the end, which are also extremely annoying. I’ve found
that these are pretty easy to correct, with arithmetic errors fixed by
writing out the computation. On the other hand, and transformations that
are made should be noted on the scratch paper, often at the top and in
large words so one can remember them.</p>
<p>There are also sillies like reading the question wrong; This used to
be an issue for me (and an annoying one too), but by reading the
question twice before doing any work, it seemed to eliminate it too.</p>
<h2 id="stop-sillying">Stop Sillying</h2>
<p>There are also some instances when sillies are rather rare, and in
most cases do not just happen at all. These are usually school tests and
olympiad problems.</p>
<p>In school tests, the ideas are almost always so simple that one just
needs to make sure their computation is right, and because the idea is
easy to come up with, there is a lot of time to check and read the
question. Thus, from here, we see a strategy; think of the problem as
simply as possible if the idea is clear, and allot enough time to check.
Checking is often easiest by first, plugging your answer back in if the
question allows; if not, then doing a sanity check; and finally, trying
the problem in a different way. Just going through your work again is
actually pretty useless as your brain goes autopilot, but going the
reverse way (from answer to original) can actually be quite effective,
because it’s “new” to the brain.</p>
<p>For olympiad problems, it’s extremely hard to silly, but it’s also
extremely hard to solve the problem. I think the reason why is because a
proof must written, and the proof must actually be true (each step has
to be logical). Thus, it’s a good idea when practicing hard problems to
also write the solutions for the problems. Don’t include every single
detail, but have an outline of the <em>strategy</em>; this also helps
with developing ideas and intuition, which can help in making problems
more simple.</p>
<h2 id="in-test-stress">In-Test Stress</h2>
<p>People cite stress of the test too as underperformance (I also do
too!) In honesty, I don’t think just spamming mock tests is going to
solve this issue, nor is anything really; the key is to treat it exactly
like a mock test.</p>
<p>Say you encounter a dificult P8 on an AIME mock; I bet that you would
probably skip it and move on. However, on the real test, our ego can get
ahead of ourselves and we just continue on that problem without
progress; this is going to kill your scores, and happened to be in both
years when I barely missed the cutoffs. Looking retrospectively, I
should hvae just had more confidence in myself; I knew I could easily do
the first 12 so I should have moved on, instead of thinking they were
boing to be even harder if P8 was already so hard.</p>
<h2 id="when-cutoffs-come-out">When Cutoffs Come Out</h2>
<p>Remembering that many people are probably also in a similar situation
won’t help; in fact, I think one needs to teach themselves how to cope
with loss. However, pain is our natural (and greatest) motivator, so
perhaps after missing a cutoff, we can be motivated to work harder.</p>
<p>It’s also important to understand one’s level; there’s a difference
between problems someone <em>can</em> solve, and problems someone
<em>does</em> solve. Missing the cutoff doesn’t mean you should re-study
the AMCs or the AIME; in fact, I think that just means you should try
challenging yourself so your confidence increases. Confidence is a
<strong>huge</strong> factor in your underperformance, so it’s best to
eliminate that. (As an anecdote, after taking an AIME-level class with
olympiad problems included in the homework sets, my AMC score increase
by almost 20 points. On the other hand, when I was “AIME level”, doing
AIME problems just because that was what I was preparing for didn’t do
as much to expand my reach, and I should’ve been doing final fives to
give me a more massive confidence boost).</p>
<p>It’s important to know that although there is a lot of time until the
next contest season, this doesn’t mean to slack. Set expectations
higher! If someone is shooting for JMO instead of AIME, they will be
inclined to study harder; even if they don’t make JMO, they may make AMC
DHR or AIME with a high enough score, which doesn’t hurt at all.</p>
