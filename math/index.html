			<h1>Math Resources</h1>
<p><strong>PSA</strong>: I’m interested in starting running a few
classes/program for mid/late AIME prep (which also helps for AMCs!). The
goal is to offer generous financial aid and flexible hours for those
interested in contests but may have barriers. If you would like to help
with deciding what topics should be included, or have anything you want
to see, please don’t hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p>This page is for any resources I have, and any advice I have for AMC
10/12 and AIME.</p>
<p>I personally like <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html">Evan
Chen’s OTIS</a> for those who are ready or interested for the math
olympiad world.</p>
<p>For earlier contests like MATHCOUNTS/AMC 8 and the early end of the
AMCs, I liked <a
href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus">Alcumus</a> to learn and
get good practice problems; I also really enjoyed <a
href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/competition-math">Competition
Math for Middle School</a>.</p>
<p>I also really like the advice on <a
href="https://web.evanchen.cc/">Evan Chen’s website</a>, especially <a
href="https://blog.evanchen.cc/2019/01/31/math-contest-platitudes-v3/">math
contest platitudes v3</a>.</p>
<p>In case someone wants, here are my <a href="scores.html">scores</a>
from my years of competing in the AMCs.</p>
