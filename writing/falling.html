			<h1>On Falling Short</h1>
<p>This post could have been much different.</p>
<p>For the past two years of my life, I’ve dedicated all of my available
time to studying for math. I didn’t care if that meant having to miss
hangouts, or spending time when I otherwise could be having fun, to
solve the next problem on the paper.</p>
<p>I grew to love math out of the hard work I put in. The struggle with
the problem became personal to me. It was all that I could afford to
focus my mind on, and everything else needed to be blocked out.</p>
<p>In a way, it was simple. I made sacrifices, and I knew that these
were the sacrifices that I had to make. I had faith that everything
would turn out fine.</p>
<p>It didn’t.</p>
<p>I know many people would wish they could have the same life as me.
But at least for myself, I have no words to describe the situation I am
in. I don’t think it’s unfair; I chose to spend more time on preparing
for olympiad problems, even if it meant a lower AIME score.</p>
<p>I didn’t make USAMO. I missed the cutoff by 2 points.</p>
<p>This is the third time that, in an odd-numbered year, I felt short of
my goal by a miniscule amount. But it hurts so much more this time,
because it is a forced end to my story, with no definitive
conclusion.</p>
<p>In seventh grade, I scored a 97.5 on the AMC 10A. The cutoff was
103.5; if I just hadn’t forgot a +1 in my equation, I would’ve made
it.</p>
<p>In ninth grade, I had a 191.5 JMO index. The cutoff was 194. If I
just had not sunk so much time on problem 8, with a messy diagram, I
could have caught my error in either problem 7 or problem 9.</p>
<p>This year, I had a 235 USAMO index. The cutoff was 237. If I had just
thought about by answer for problem 12, and realized that a factor of
sqrt2 makes no sense in 3D and is only a projection, I would have made
it.</p>
<p>More than anything, a void is now in my life. I centered the past two
years around math competitions; it was a hard choice, a sacrifice I
made. When I decided to do so, around March in freshman year, I knew it
would be a sacrifice. But the full realization of what it means to
<em>truly sacrifice</em>, for it to work out the way you didn’t expect,
has not hit until today.</p>
<p>I could’ve continued fencing; sometimes I think that if math was not
in my life, fencing would have consumed me. Yet instead of choosing the
path of a recruited athlete, I made the decision to instead become a
MOPper; part of me just wanted to prove that it is not an opportunity
locked away for a few select students who had the opportunity earlier
on. I was close, but fell short.</p>
<p>I don’t believe the lessons I learned, about suppressing emotions,
distractions, and immediate pleasures, will go to waste. I don’t think
the feeling of recognizing when you truly understand a problem versus
when you can only partially grasp it, will be useless. The skill of
knowing when to ask for help, and what is the missing step, is crucial
anywhere. A chapter might have ended, but another has started.</p>
<p>What hurts the most is that now, all of that is a memory. It’s not
the present anymore, not a continuation. I’ve always hated looking back
and reminiscing; it just feels like nothing is being changed. And as I
often associate the music I listen to with the moment and feelings I
have when listening to it, it hurts even more when I replay those songs
that filled my head during that time.</p>
<p>Maybe now, I can try to teach what I’ve learned, with no costs,
something I’ve always wanted to do. Maybe now, I can try to learn
guitar, something I’ve always wanted to do. Maybe now, I can try to
invest and earn money, something I’ve always wanted to do.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s not a bad thing. Maybe everything will work out, if I keep
my head clear and work towards the next goal. Maybe all the things that
happen to me, happen to me for a reason. I could’ve lived a much
different life; a totally different set of things could have happened to
me. But would it really have made it better? I don’t know. And that’s
what makes this life so special.</p>
