			<h1>Asking Questions</h1>
<p>Recently, as I see my friends and others get their college
acceptances, I can’t help but feel a little sad that soon they’re gone.
They’ve helped me a lot, and I realize that it was because I wasn’t
afraid to ask questions.</p>
<p>“Once you know what it is in life that you want to do, then the world
basically becomes your library.” - Kobe Bryant</p>
<h2 id="open-bouting">Open Bouting</h2>
<p>As a fencer, there are practices called “open bouting”, where people
come at a scheduled time and date to fence with others rather than have
structured drills or lessons. Naturally, making the most out of it means
initiating a move by asking someone to fence.</p>
<p>When I was 12 or 13, my mom would bring me to these, but I would
rarely ask others to fence; either they would ask me, or I would end up
fencing my brother. It was only because I didn’t want to waste my time
that I attempted to ask others. For nearly two months, I was scared to
approach others even though no one ever said no, but slowly I started to
get used to it.</p>
<h2 id="mentors">Mentors</h2>
<p>Soon, my coach started asking me what I learned from fencing the
older kids. I truthfully told him I wasn’t sure, and so he said it was
necessary that I ask for advice when I need it.</p>
<p>I started to think more about fencing on the car ride to practices,
especially about the questions I had or issues that I might need to try
and correct. I was comfortable asking my coach those questions, and it
didn’t take long before I was asking older fencers for advice after my
bouts.</p>
<p>This slowly started to spill into other areas of my life. The
greatest impact this has had on me was in math. I didn’t have much
structured training in middle school besides weekly Math Club, and they
didn’t have resources to train beyond MATHCOUNTS. I had to train for the
AMC 10 using my own plan of one past test a week, and begged my mom to
buy me a math book.</p>
<p>In eighth grade I finally read “Stop looking for the right training”
on the Art of Problem Solving website (a website with a ton of math
resources and forums). It was through that post that I found Evan Chen’s
website, which led me to find Dennis Chen’s MAST program. I shot Dennis
an email to apply to MAST, and he was happy to let me in. When I needed
help for AMC 10 preparation, Dennis was willing to spend his time
detailing is practice philosophy.</p>
<p>That email to Dennis gave me some of the best AIME resources, which
led to me meeting others who were helpful as well. In fact, the MAST
community was supportive (and extremely talented) as well, and they
inspired me to work harder. Even when I missed JMO by a small margin, I
was spurred to apply to OTIS where I was encouraged to ask even more
questions. I found a support system, and eventually a mentor to work
closely with.</p>
<h2 id="enjoy-it">Enjoy it</h2>
<p>One by one, every one of those people who helped me are leaving,
moving on to bigger and better things. Sometimes I think about whether
or not they’ll remember me, or realize the impact they made. I wonder if
I’m ready for that next step, or if there’s already people who are
looking up to me that I just don’t realize.</p>
<p>Above all, it was the people who I met that made asking questions so
much worth it. In the fencing community and in the math community, I’ve
gotten to meet some great people. And that’s all I could ask for.</p>
