			<h1>On Goals</h1>
<p>I’m currently reading <em>Sapiens</em> by Harari. I’ve found it to be
a really good book, and one part resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship, and not for
the last time… they double their efforts and keep slaving away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It always seemed like the ideal life to secure a high-paying job, and
to be able to raise a family and retire early. But what history should
have taught us is that what we earn eventually becomes things that we
take for granted. And life only gets harder.</p>
<p>Consider the example of the agricultural revolution. Historians and
most people alive today view it as one of the most remarkable
revolutions that turned humans from an insignificant speck on Earth to
the most powerful species that has the fate of the world in its hands.
This is far from the truth; the process of cultivating crops was
gruesome and in most cases much harder than the hunter-gatherer way of
life. Diseases became rampant, the human body weakened over time, and
societies were more susceptible to famine and drought. Even today, many
of the creations that we have made to reduce mental and physical burden,
such as phones, emails and artificial intelligence, have only lead to
more anxiety and a stronger feeling of being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The truth is, the promise of a better future is neither guaranteed,
nor even based on much true evidence. The idea of pain today for the
comfort of tomorrow used to be my way to justify the work that I put day
in and day out; but recently I’ve realized how silly this idea is.<a

<p>School teaches us that hard work pays off. And the common
misconception, or maybe even intentional implication, is that we should
focus on goals that satisfy us and use that to justify the effort,
however burdensome and numbing, that is required. This is far from the
truth, because once someone does reach that goal, then there is yet
another objective to work for, or an inevitable feeling of
emptiness.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to discourage those working towards their
goals; I think discipline is best learned this way, because
realistically nothing can be fun doing all the time. I’ve made excuses
for myself to take days off when I shouldn’t have, and it only makes me
feel worse the next day. Conversely, pushing myself to go further even
on the toughest days makes it more rewarding; that’s what it takes to be
a champion, anyways.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, the question of whether or not the work is
fulfilling needs to be answered. Using competitions to motivate
students, or athletes, can be a double-edged sword; perhaps the only
reason they pursue their respective skill is due to the thrill of
winning and putting in hours every day to see progress. That could be
why many student athletes lose their interest of pursuing their sport
once in college. On the other hand, it stimulates interest that can
develop a normal kid to be one of the brightest cybersecurity
researchers, or help someone find a bright future that they otherwise
would not have found.</p>
<p>The last few days have helped me realize this. What I’ve been chasing
this whole time is meaningless, if it’ll all come to an end with a
feeling of relief and a task being checked off.</p>
<p>Most of the time I try to reflect on my journey, I’ve always had it
through the lens of hard work and success. I can confidently say that I
was influenced by Kobe Bryant to work as hard as I could, trying to
outwork anyone and learn my craft. However, I can much less confidently
determine the motivation for doing so. Sometimes I believe it’s because
I have a faith that everything will work out in the end, and that faith
keeps me going. Other times, it’s because I want to prevent any feeling
of regret, and not leave any “what if’s” about my effort.</p>
<p>I hope to answer this question soon; at our core, we should do the
work that we love doing, regardless of the outcome. The best work is
often done when someone loves it. There is no guarantee of a better
future, but we can make sure that we can do the work that we love. And
(un)coincidentally, most people who do get good results from their work
live with the latter idea in mind.</p>

and to a lesser extent people who justify selfish actions by believing
they are making a big impact. However, I admire educators, scientists,
etc. for the passion they have for their work; but it is ironic that
those who benefit society the most are often paid the least.<a
