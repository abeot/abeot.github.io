			<h1>Advice for Studying for AIME</h1>
<p>I’ve noticed that my biggest increases in skill have always occured
when I’ve done significantly harder problems, so that’s what my training
philosophy is on. I also tend to work harder when I know the material is
<strong>high quality</strong> and arranged <strong>in a way that makes
it easy to digest and complete</strong>, which is why I enjoy going
through well structured handouts. However, <strong>classes serve as a
way to pace myself and force progress to be made</strong>, which can be
good during slumps or when other activities take priority.</p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes that I’ve made in training is <strong>not
having a decisive plan</strong>. This often leads to very little
progress being made each day or very little problems done. This is a
problem that things like handouts and classes are meant to be done.
However, it’s important to have <strong>incentive for the material to be
completed</strong>, whether or not the <a
href="/writing/motivation.html">motivation is extrinsic or
intrinsic</a>.</p>
<p>Now, here is a plan intended for self-study, or people who like
handouts and learning by doing problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Start by getting a rough overview of what to know, by either
looking at an AIME class syllabus or looking through BOGTRO’s AIME Study
Guide, found <a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/icds9u5yo0xypyf/AIMElist.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Start learning the concepts necessary by doing handouts on the
topics. Order does not matter, but do the more fundamental or common
topics first. <strong>It is at this step that you should start saving
solution outlines of completed problems</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Start doing problems by <strong>starting at the earliest AIMEs,
since these require knowledge of fundamentals</strong>. Don’t worry if
the problems start out easy, 1-5 is still good silly practice;
<strong>make sure to save solution outlines so you understand the
thought process</strong>. Attempt all questions, but if there is a
question you have no idea, don’t worry. For questions that you make
substantial progress but do not complete or miss by a litte bit, look at
the solution and then try to solve the problem using the newfound
knowledge. Remember, these problems are the ones just above your
level.</p></li>
<li><p>The AMCs might be coming up, so just mock once a week-the
problems should feel really natural now that the motivation for AIME
problems has been picked up.</p></li>
<li><p>If you still have months left and have completed almost all the
past AIMEs, <strong>start going through the problems that were too hard
at the start</strong>. You should find solutions that become more
natural because the motivation has been learned. Also, <strong>start
going through college competitions, like HMMT Feb, CMIMC and
PUMaC</strong>. Practice with them like how you practiced with the
AIMEs. <strong>Remember, solutions should still be
recorded</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that there is still time left, <strong>you should not
comfortably be able to solve the first 12 untimed</strong>. At about a
month before the competition, <strong>start doing mock AIMEs once per
week; too much does not help, mock AIMEs are only intended to make one
comfortable with testing strategy and difficulty, not actual
practice</strong>. If you haven’t finished the previous staps, don’t
worry; just start the weekly mocks a month before.</p></li>
<li><p>The day before the test, just relax, maybe solve some interesting
problems but nothing that is too infuriating. <strong>Sleep well, make
sure to eat a banana and dark chocolate the day of</strong>. Also,
remember not to treat it as a real thing but just like another mock; in
particular, <strong>don’t change the test strategy and feel free to skip
around, and use a lot of scratch paper and keep work neat and
checked</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The point of this outline is not to serve as a plan, but rather an
idea of how much work it will take. <strong>Take this with a grain of
salt, as this advice will not apply to everyone</strong>. In particular,
<strong>if you feel more satisfaction saying you did all past AIMEs
rather than actually treating each problem as nice example and a way to
learn, you are doing it wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>Something to note: part of writing down solutions is <strong>to make
the thought process clear, thus minimizing sillies</strong>. Also, this
strategy probably takes about 9 months or a year to execute, so it is
something perfect to employ for someone who has just qualified for AIME
or AMC DHR and has gotten a 2-7 on AIME. If you barely missed the
AMO/JMO cutoff, no pressure; just make sure to be doing computational
practice with HMMT/CMIMC/PUMaC, but you should be training for oly.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you are not doing self-study and doing actual classes,
it would look a lot different. Just following the curriculum should be
fine, and mixing in extra practice and mocks is already enough before
the AMC/AIME.</p>
