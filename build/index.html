			<h1>Albert Cao’s Website</h1>
<p>I’m Albert Cao, and I’m currently a junior in high school.</p>
<p>Currently, my academic interests lie in math and computer science,
specifically in olympiads and competitions. I’m also interested in how
both fields can be used to change lives, and I would love to pursue
research in those fields.</p>
<p>Aside from math and programming competitions, my other hobbies
include fencing and traveling.</p>
<p>Some more about me:</p>
<p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li>I played cello (with Dr. Maxim Kozlov) until my freshman year of
high school, due to conflicts with fencing</li>
<li>My favorite cello piece is Saint Saens Cello Concerto 1</li>
<li>Some artists I like include (in order of most recent to least
recent): SZA, Frank Ocean, Playboi Carti, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West,
Coldplay, Laufey, beabadoobee, keshi</li>
<li>My favorite song is Runaway (it’ll always remind me of my grind for
MOP), before that it was Cupid by FIFTY-FIFTY</li>
<li>I like to try out different music, but K-pop never stuck with
me</li>
</ul>
<p>Sports:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve fenced competitively for over seven years</li>
<li>I am an épée fencer and fence with DC Fencers Club</li>
<li>My favorite city for a fencing tournament is Salt Lake City, worst
is Phoenix in the summer</li>
<li>I also enjoy watching basketball; my favorite player is Kyrie
Irving, and my favorite team is the Dallas Mavs</li>
</ul>
