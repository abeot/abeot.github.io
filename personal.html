			<h1>Personal Interests</h1>

high school, due to conflicts with fencing

recent): Lamp, SZA, Frank Ocean, Playboi Carti, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye
West, Coldplay, Laufey, beabadoobee, keshi</li>
<li>My favorite song is White Ferrari, follow by Runaway (it’ll always
remind me of my grind for MOP); before that it was Cupid by

me</li>
